# mechanical model of vocal cords

For my senior capstone project I built a mechanical model of the vocal cords and I made a a couple of YouTube videos [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SmyLshMzR4) and [video 2 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyQxzByp0m0) to capture the project. Every year I get at least one request asking details of the model.

I was naive about the awesomeness of GitHub back then (2009), and so I failed to properly archive all the design files related to the project. Here are the files that I could find.

The inspiration for the model was work from Kotaro Fukui and colleagues of the [Takanishi lab](http://www.takanishi.mech.waseda.ac.jp/top/research/voice/) at Waseda University.
